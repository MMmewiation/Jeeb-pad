## Overview

- **Purpose:** Jeeb pad aims to solve the problem of bloated software like Microsoft Notepad, which is increasingly incorporating AI features we don't want or need.  
- **Background:** On Nov 4th, 2024, I created this repo after being notified while using Notepad that I could shorten or lengthen my text, and I noticed that even applications like Paint are adding AI features despite there being little use for them.

## Features

- **Save Memory:** When you save a file, it will remember that directory for subsequent saves. (Took days to debug this feature, so I had to mention it.)
- **Opening Files:** Pretty self-explanatory; you can open files.
- **Saving As:** If you don't want to save to the current file, you can use "Save As" to create a new one.
